Transition and animation

Transition:- wait until change in a property occurs
	then allows those changes to take place over time
Animation :- provide keyframes for more controll over the animation
	

/*** Transition Element ***/
transition-property:- define which property the transition effect should
			be applied to
transtion-duration:- defines how long the transition effect should take to
			complete
transition-timing-function:- defines the acceleration curve for the transition
				common possible values(ease, linear, forward, etc)
transition-delay:

/*** syntax for animation in css ***/
@keyframes nameOfAnimation {}

animation-name:- for selecting the keyframe 
you want to use to animate the element
animation-duration:- sets the time it takes for the animation to complete one lap
animation-timing-function:- ease, ease-in-out, linear
animation-delay:-
animation-iteration-count:- defines how many times the animation should run 
animation-direction:- default is normal, other option is reverse
animation-fill-mode:- options are none, forward, backward, both


scroll watch
animation-timeline: scroll();
animation-timing-function: linear;

we have animation-timeline: view(); which happen when you scroll to that div
animation-range-start: cover, contain;
animation-range: entry, exit;

@media(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
	// animation should go here, this help on those who don't want animation on device
